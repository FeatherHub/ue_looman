sound
  cue, wav
  spatialization
    attenuation
      inner att, outer att

modular style
  a cue file
  an attenuation file

  a cue file + an attenuation file

  author separately
    parallelism
    e.g. developing an DamagePopup_Widget
  mix and match
    use things in progress (or to be changed)
    without being broken

monolithic style
  cue and attenuation in a file

map an SFX at each phase of a process
  begin, flying, impact

map an anim at each state of an object
  alive, dead, air, run

sound logic
  modulator
    pitch, volume
  doppler
  mixing

goal: variety

Pattern
  write a static value at a position
  wire a value from other to the slot 
    bind
  
  show hardwired static value "99" when health changed
  show a damage value when health changed
